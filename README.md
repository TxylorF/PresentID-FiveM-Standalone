This is the ShowID script I have been working on myself and I would like to share it with you all, I have only used it with noahchat so I dont know how colour codes work with the normal chat, try it out and lmk.

has a 20m radius however it can be changed in the client.lua file

Intended use:
/id Name
this is so an officer can see the ID so it can be used in a CAD.
